- Implement auto-save functionality for each open file to prevent data loss.

## 3. User Interface and Design

### 3.1 Overall Aesthetic

  - A main content area for rendered Markdown and editor, capable of displaying multiple files efficiently
  - A floating action button for quick access to key functions (e.g., create new file, print, save all)
  - A footer with additional options and dark mode toggle

### 3.3 Typography

- Use a modern, readable font for both the UI and rendered Markdown content that remains clear when viewing multiple files.
- Implement a clear typographic hierarchy to distinguish between different levels of headers and content across files.

### 3.4 Icons and Visual Elements

- Utilize a consistent, visually appealing icon set throughout the application, including specific icons for multi-file operations.
- Implement subtle visual cues (e.g., hover effects, active states) to improve user interaction feedback, especially for distinguishing between multiple open files.

## 4. Multi-File Handling

### 4.1 File Selection
