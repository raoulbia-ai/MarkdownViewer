# Revised Markdown Viewer Application Specification

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the revised specifications for a modern, visually appealing Markdown viewer application. The application will allow users to view, render, edit, and print multiple Markdown files simultaneously, with a focus on a sleek design, improved multi-file handling, and enhanced editing functionality.

## 2. Core Functionalities

### 2.1 Multi-File System Browser

- Implement a visually attractive file system browser that explicitly allows and encourages selection of multiple Markdown (.md) files.
- Use a modern file picker component that supports:
  - Multiple file selection through checkboxes or Ctrl/Cmd+Click
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for multiple files
  - Folder selection to import all Markdown files within
- Display selected files in a stylish list or grid view, clearly indicating the number of files selected.
- Implement a search or filter function to easily locate specific files within the selected set.

### 2.2 Multi-File Markdown Rendering

- Render multiple selected Markdown files simultaneously.
- Implement a tab or accordion system to navigate between different files easily.
- Provide an option for side-by-side comparison of two or more files.
- Use a modern Markdown parsing library capable of handling multiple files efficiently.
- Ensure proper rendering of all Markdown elements, including:
  - Headers, paragraphs, lists, and blockquotes
  - Links and images
  - Tables
  - Task lists
- Implement syntax highlighting for code blocks to enhance readability across all open files.
- Support for common Markdown extensions (e.g., GitHub Flavored Markdown).

### 2.3 PDF Printing

- Allow printing of single files or batch printing of multiple selected files.
- Implement a "Print as PDF" option that generates PDFs of only the rendered Markdown content.
- For multiple files, offer options to:
  - Print each file as a separate PDF
  - Combine all selected files into a single PDF with clear demarcation between files
- Ensure that the PDF output excludes any application UI elements, navigation bars, or unrelated content.
- Implement a print preview feature supporting both single and multiple file previews.
- Add options for users to customize the PDF output (e.g., font size, margins, header/footer) for batch printing.

### 2.4 Mobile Responsiveness

- Design the application layout to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly, even when handling multiple files.
- Implement a fluid grid system that adapts to various screen sizes, with a focus on efficient space utilization for multiple file views.
- Use touch-friendly controls and gestures for mobile users to switch between files easily.
- Ensure that all features, including multiple file selection and PDF printing, work seamlessly on mobile devices.

### 2.5 Dark Mode

- Implement an aesthetically pleasing dark mode option for the application that works well with multiple open files.
- Create a custom color palette for dark mode that ensures proper contrast and reduces eye strain, especially during extended multi-file reading or editing sessions.
- Add a prominent, easily accessible toggle for switching between light and dark modes.
- Ensure smooth transitions when switching between modes for a polished user experience across all open files.

### 2.6 Markdown Editing

- Provide a sleek, modern text editor capable of handling multiple files simultaneously.
- Implement an "Edit" button for each file that switches the view from rendered Markdown to source editing mode.
- In edit mode, display a "Save" button that, when clicked, updates the rendered Markdown and returns to the view mode.
- Include real-time preview of edited content alongside the editor for each file.
- Implement syntax highlighting in the editor for improved readability and editing experience across all open files.
- Implement auto-save functionality for each open file to prevent data loss.

## 3. User Interface and Design

### 3.1 Overall Aesthetic

- Adopt a clean, minimalist design language throughout the application that scales well with multiple open files.
- Use a modern color scheme with carefully selected accent colors to highlight important elements and differentiate between files.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience when switching between files and modes (view/edit).

### 3.2 Layout

- Create an intuitive, visually appealing layout with the following components:
  - A stylish header with the application logo and main navigation
  - A sidebar for file selection and list of open files, with clear indication of the number of files selected/open
  - A main content area for rendered Markdown and editor, capable of displaying multiple files efficiently
  - Floating action buttons for key functions (e.g., edit, save, print)
  - A footer with additional options and dark mode toggle
- Design the sidebar and main area as independent components to facilitate PDF generation of only the main area content.

### 3.3 Typography

- Use a modern, readable font for both the UI and rendered Markdown content that remains clear when viewing multiple files.
- Implement a clear typographic hierarchy to distinguish between different levels of headers and content across files.

### 3.4 Icons and Visual Elements

- Utilize a consistent, visually appealing icon set throughout the application, including specific icons for multi-file operations.
- Implement subtle visual cues (e.g., hover effects, active states) to improve user interaction feedback, especially for distinguishing between multiple open files and edit/view modes.

## 4. Multi-File Handling

### 4.1 File Selection

- Implement a visually appealing file selection process that clearly supports and encourages multiple file selection.
- Add a recent files section for quick access to frequently used documents, allowing multiple selection from recent files as well.
- Provide clear visual feedback on the number of files selected and their total size.

### 4.2 File Saving

- Implement a robust file saving system with clear visual feedback for saving multiple files.
- Provide individual "Save" buttons for each file in edit mode.
- Add a "Save All" option for quickly saving changes to all modified files.
- Implement version history for each file to prevent data loss and allow reverting changes.

This revised specification incorporates the new requirements, emphasizing the edit/view mode toggle, correct Markdown rendering, and the separation of sidebar and main area components. The ability to handle multiple files is maintained throughout all features, and the design considerations have been updated to account for efficient multi-file management while maintaining a modern, visually appealing aesthetic.
